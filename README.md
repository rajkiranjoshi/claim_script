# claim_script

Note in claim-cs1010x-ay1516s2.js, the line `$.getScript(core_script)` will only work correctly if jquery is included. Now jquery can be easily included using a plugin like [Javascript Library for Console](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-library-for-co/hoooohdeiheekoemicbaeeiaokjhnpko)
